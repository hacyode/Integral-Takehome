# Integral-Takehome
 
First cut:

1. Has an endpoint that can return the "total pooled ETH" and the "total shares" from the stETH token contract.
2. An endpoint that returns the most recent address that deposited into the stETH pool
3. Given any address, return all the transactions that went to or from that address
4. Rudimentary tests

Need to:
1. Figure out crawl/sync phase of returning all txns.
2. Integration/function/unit tests
